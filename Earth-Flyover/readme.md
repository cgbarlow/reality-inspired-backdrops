Inspired by an image taken of the Earth, with cities streaking by below, captured in January 2025 by NASA Astronaut Don Pettit aboard the Dragon Crew 9 spacecraft.

"An ultra-high-definition view from space of Earth rotating below a fixed, steady camera vantage point. The distant stars and Milky Way form a crisp, dark backdrop, while the vibrant glow of sunrise gently illuminates the planet’s curved horizon in vivid reds and oranges. City lights streak across the surface, conveying smooth, continuous motion. The entire scene should loop seamlessly, maintaining a cinematic sense of depth and realism, so that as Earth completes its rotation, it transitions back to the start without any visible breaks."
