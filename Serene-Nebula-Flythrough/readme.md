> _"Begin with a wide cosmic vista of the Serpens Nebula, softly illuminated by gentle starlight filtering through filaments of dust and gas. Over an extended span of millions of years, let every shift be exquisitely gradual: the faint glow of protostars intensifies at a nearly imperceptible pace; slender outflows and wisps of dust slowly reshape the surrounding clouds, their motion so subtle it’s almost like watching a gentle tide inch its way across a shoreline._

> _Stars gradually increase in luminosity, one by one, and clusters form in a hushed, delicate dance of light. Embellish the scene with the soft ebb and flow of orange and red shock waves that spread slowly through the nebula, carving new paths through the gas and dust. Watch as the once-dense pockets of cloud thin almost imperceptibly, revealing sparkling newborn stars against the dark tapestry of space. Let the final image linger on the tranquil aftermath, with the nebula now faint and transparent, softly framing the glittering star cluster that remains. Throughout the entire sequence, ensure the changes are gentle and mesmerizing, as though each transformation unfolds in serene, timeless slow motion"_
