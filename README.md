# Reality-inspired Backdrops
Creating eye-catching animated backdrops inspired by nature.

Add these to your Microsoft Teams or Zoom background and wow your teammates!

## Method
- _I get inspired by an image, download it._
- ([Pixlr](https://pixlr.com)/[Flux](https://getimg.ai)) _Process the image to get it into the right format (Resize / Upscale / Generative fill)._
- ([ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)) _Generate a suitable video prompt._
- ([Sora](https://sora.com/)) _Run an image to video prompt. Re-roll until I get a video I like._
- ([Sora](https://sora.com/)) _Create a Loop of the video._

## How to use the backdrops

I have not been able to get the MP4 method in New Teams to work, however the GIF method does.
